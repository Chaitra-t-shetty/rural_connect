## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Millions of rural workers â€” potters, farmers, tailors, carpenters, and more â€” lack access to digital tools that could help them find jobs, market their skills, or build a professional presence online. This disconnect limits their opportunities for employment and fair compensation.

**RuralConnect bridges this digital gap** by providing a dedicated platform for these users to:
- Build professional profiles
- Share posts showcasing their skills
- Connect with potential employers, buyers, or collaborators
